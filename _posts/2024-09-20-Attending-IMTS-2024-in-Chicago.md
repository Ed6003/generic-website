# Attending IMTS 2024 in Chicago

The International Manufacturing Technology Show (IMTS) 2024, held in Chicago, was an incredible experience that brought together industry leaders, innovators, and enthusiasts from around the globe. Held every 2 years the IMTS showcased cutting-edge technologies and the future of manufacturing.

## Key Highlights

- **North Building**: Centered around automation using robotics. One of the largest booths was from [Fanuc](https://www.fanuc.eu/uk-en) which featured automated tooling and production lines, automated welding and AI powered inspection able to detect loose screws through imaging and LiDAR.
- **East Building**: Metrology focus, strong expositions by [Renishaw](https://www.renishaw.com/en/) including UK representatives. Quality assurance through metrology and inspection using probing, imaging, LiDAR and many other technologies.
- **South Building**: Subtractive manufacturing hall, including milling, turning and cutting. Included extremely precise wire EDM and EDM machines.
- **West Building**: Additive pavillion showcasing many additive manufacturing technologies but with a focus on metal 3D printing and high performance polymers. Interesting projects that merged additive and subtractive manufacturing for complex geometry with precise and smoooth surface finish.

## Personal Takeaways

Attending the IMTS 2024 was a great personal experience, it helped me understand the importance of staying ahead of industry trends to remain competitive in a global market.

The International Manufacturing and Technology Show (IMTS) is, as the name suggests, primarily a Manufacturing show. However, I wish that the metrology and quality assurance focused more on material characterisation, including non-destructive material characterisation instead of solely dimensional accuracy. I believe such techniques are essential for the adoption of additive manufacturing where residual stresses and internal structure are less well understood and predictable than subtractive manufacturing from a workpiece.

The Renishaw Equator™ was at several booths, showing widespread adoption within other solutions. In terms of metrology I have used photogrammetry extensively, collaborating with engineers, artists and museums.
